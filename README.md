# Hyperion-Dev-Board

Heres a simple dev board that i make for Hackclub Blueprint. it has everything that I would want on a dev board, alot of GPIOs alot of Grounds and some other things (listed below). this was a fun and prety easy project to make when I started to understand what i needed to do. it was foundational to my ability to make PCBs. i hope that ill be able to make more dev boards later in life.
